# Open Source Vulnerability Metrics

### Description: 

Mining the [_Software Heritage Graph Dataset_](https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-dataset/graph/dataset.html); a very large dataset containing the development history of publicly available software. The dataset links together source code files organized in directories, commits tracking evolution over time, up to full snapshots of version control systems (VCS) repositories. 
* Includes a full dataset at 1.2TB and two "teaser" datasets: **popular-4k** at 27GB and **popular-3k-python** at 5.3 GB.
	* The popular-4k teaser contains a subset of 4000 popular repositories from GitHub, Gitlab, PyPI and Debian.
	* The popular-3k-python teaser contains a subset of 3052 popular repositories tagged as being written in the Python language, from GitHub, Gitlab, PyPI and Debian.

Our major goals consist of: cross-referencing known software vulnerabilities found on the [National Vulneraibiltiy Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) with commit ids found in the _Software Heritage Graph Dataset_ and determining if the latency between when a software bug is discovered and when it is patched gives us any insight on the severity of the bug or responsiveness of the developers.
