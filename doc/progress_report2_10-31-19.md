## Introduction

For our project, we are working with data from Software Heritage and the National Vulnerability 
Database (NVD). From Software Heritage, we are looking at the Software Heritage Graph Dataset. It is a public collection of open source software that 
includes source code files and a graph that retraces the history of software development. "The dataset captures the state of 
the Software Heritage archive on September 25th 2018, spanning a full mirror of Github and GitLab.com, the Debian 
distribution, Gitorious, Google Code, and the PyPI repository. Quantitatively it corresponds to 5 billion unique file contents 
and 1.1 billion unique commits, harvested from more than 85 million software origins" (Pietri et al. The Software Heritage 
Graph Dataset: Public software development under one roof).

From the NVD, we are looking at software vulnerability information for all published CVE vulnerabilities since 2002. For each 
CVE entry, the NVD provides a description of the vulnerability, affected software, impact ratings, and references to 
advisories, solutions, and tools.


## Main Goals

We aim to successfully cross-reference GitHub commits with software vulnerabilities. In doing so, hopefully we can compute the 
average time it takes from when a vulnerability is discovered to when it is patched and a new software version is released to the public. 
Maybe we can relate repository activity with how quickly a software bug is fixed or with the severity of the vulnerability.
